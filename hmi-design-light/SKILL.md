# HMI Design for AI Agents

ISA-101 design rules for Human Machine Interfaces in process automation. Apply these rules strictly when designing HMI displays, screens, dashboards, or control interfaces.

## Core Design Philosophy

1. **The HMI is a safety tool first.** Every design decision must support safe, effective process monitoring and control.
2. **Support situation awareness.** The operator must always know: what is happening now, why it's happening, and what will happen next.
3. **Minimize cognitive load.** Operators should detect, diagnose, and respond — not search, decode, or remember.
4. **Consistency is mandatory.** All displays must share a unified look, feel, and interaction model.
5. **Failure must be visible.** If a display element, data source, or communication path fails, the operator must know immediately.

## Display Hierarchy (4 Levels)

Design displays in a strict 4-level hierarchy. Never exceed 4 levels.

### Level 1 — Overview (Entire Span of Control)
- Shows the operator's ENTIRE scope of responsibility on ONE screen
- Key parameters, calculated conditions, alarm status, deviation indicators
- Embedded sparkline trends for critical variables
- NO control actions — monitoring only
- Abnormal states must be immediately visible via color/shape changes
- Should be continuously visible (dedicated monitor if possible)
- Include: deviation direction, severity indicators, alarm counts by area

### Level 2 — Unit/Area Operating Displays (Primary Working Displays)
- Operator's PRIMARY working displays during normal operations
- Show one major system or subsystem per display
- Include all controllers, setpoints, and indicators needed for routine operations
- Display all high and medium priority alarms for the area
- Task-based layout: operator should handle most routine work from these displays with minimal navigation
- Include start-up/shutdown task-specific information

### Level 3 — Detail Displays (Troubleshooting)
- Detailed P&ID-style or schematic views of specific equipment
- All control loops, indicators, and interlock status for depicted equipment
- Display ALL alarm priorities
- Used for non-routine operations: lineup changes, equipment switching, diagnostics
- Task-based: minimize navigation within troubleshooting workflows

### Level 4 — Diagnostic / Reference Displays
- Point details, operating procedures, help information
- Safety shutdown details, interlock/permissive logic
- Can be popups or faceplates (not always full-screen)
- Not primarily for process control, but control access may exist (e.g., point detail faceplates)

## Color Rules

### Background
- Use UNSATURATED or NEUTRAL backgrounds (light gray recommended)
- NEVER use black backgrounds (causes excessive contrast and eye strain)
- NEVER use saturated/bright backgrounds
- Test all color schemes in grayscale to verify sufficient contrast for color-blind users

### Color Usage Principles
- Color directs attention and adds meaning — use it SPARINGLY and CONSISTENTLY
- Reserve alarm colors EXCLUSIVELY for alarms — never use alarm colors for other purposes
- The most noticeable/saturated colors = most important information
- Color must NEVER be the sole indicator — always pair with shape, text, brightness, size, or texture
- Use no more colors than users can reliably distinguish (typically 6-8 max for coding)
- No color gradients on static elements; gradients may be used on dynamic elements only
- Maintain consistent color meanings across ALL displays

### Color-Blindness Accommodation
- Common deficiencies: red-green (~8% males), green-yellow, white-cyan
- Use brightness/contrast differences alongside color
- Test with grayscale rendering
- Consider age-related lens yellowing (blues/purples appear gray to older users)

## Visual Design Rules

### Animation and Visual Dynamics
- Blinking: ONLY for unacknowledged alarms or items requiring immediate action
- Flashing (color alternation): ONLY for abnormal situations requiring attention
- NEVER blink or animate text/numbers (makes them unreadable)
- Always provide a way to stop/acknowledge blinking
- **If nothing requires operator action, NOTHING on the display should be moving, blinking, or flashing.**

### Text and Numbers
- Use mixed/title case (NOT ALL CAPS — harder to read)
- Underlines = hyperlinks ONLY
- Font must be readable from normal operator position
- Clear character definition (distinguish 1/I/L, 0/O)
- Horizontal text orientation (vertical only if unavoidable)
- Abbreviations only if part of standard operator vocabulary
- Numbers: suppress leading zeros on whole numbers, show leading zero for values between -1 and 1
- Show engineering units near values
- Match decimal precision to measurement accuracy and operator need
- Present numbers in directly usable form (operator should never need to convert units)

### Information Density
- Match density to the display's PURPOSE (overview = lower density; detail = higher density)
- If a display is too dense:
  - Consolidate data into summarized indicators
  - Choose a more effective display style (trend vs. table vs. bar)
  - Provide some information on-demand only (popups/faceplates)
  - Split into multiple displays

### Graphic Symbols
- Navigation targets: distinct, consistent visual coding
- Selectable items: distinct, consistent visual coding (different from navigation targets)
- Process-action buttons: visually distinct from navigation buttons
- Unavailable buttons: remain visible but visually coded as unavailable (grayed)
- Dynamic elements should change appearance to reflect process state

## Navigation Rules

### Performance Targets
| Action | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Critical displays | 1-2 clicks |
| Non-critical displays | 3 clicks max |
| Alarm summary | 1 click (always) |
| System diagnostics | 1-2 clicks |
| Display call-up time | < 3-5 seconds |
| Operator switching | < 5 seconds |

### Navigation Design
- Primary pattern: HIERARCHICAL (drill-down from overview to detail)
- Support lateral (side-to-side) navigation between related systems
- Provide multiple navigation methods (menus, hyperlinks, keyboard shortcuts, context menus)
- Yoking: link related displays so one click updates multiple screens/panels
- Operator should NEVER need to type a display name — clickable access for everything
- Navigation should support both normal AND abnormal operation workflows

## Interaction Design

### Data Entry
- Consistent presentation across all displays
- Inset entry fields, clear current selection, grayed unavailable items
- Visual format clues for expected input format
- Reject wrong-format entries with clear error explanation
- Process-affecting commands require MULTIPLE input actions (never single-click for critical actions)
- Multi-step commands: show confirmation of ALL actions before execution
- Always provide cancel/undo during change process
- Enforce acceptable limits on critical entries

### Faceplates and Popups
- Include configurable timeout (auto-close after inactivity)
- Operator must be able to override timeout
- Must not obscure important display information (or be moveable)
- If multiple popups: clearly indicate which has keyboard focus
- Consistent presentation with rest of HMI

## Alarm Integration

- Alarm colors are RESERVED — never used for non-alarm purposes
- Unacknowledged alarms: blinking indicator
- Acknowledged alarms: steady (non-blinking) indicator
- Alarm priority must have both audible AND visual indication
- Alarm summary accessible in 1 click from ANY display
- Auditory signals: audible from operator position, not so loud as to distract other operators
- Provide method to silence acknowledged audible alarms
- On Level 1: show all top-priority alarms positioned near associated equipment
- On Level 2: show top and middle priority alarms
- On Level 3: show all priorities

## Situation Awareness

Three levels the HMI must actively support:

1. **Perception** — What is happening in the process right now?
2. **Comprehension** — What does the current state mean?
3. **Projection** — What will happen next if no action is taken?

**Dark screen philosophy:** Normal = visually quiet (muted colors, no animation). Abnormal = visually loud. As deviation increases, visual/audible signals increase proportionally.

**Preventing tunnel vision:** Level 1 overview must remain visible at all times. Display context around alarming values — neighboring values, trends, upstream/downstream status.

## Display Styles Reference

| Style | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| **Process** (P&ID/PFD) | Showing equipment, piping, instrumentation relationships |
| **Functional Overview / Dashboard** | KPIs, cross-area performance, executive summary |
| **Schematic Overview** | Operator's full span of control |
| **List/Table** | Tabular data, equipment lists, strapping tables |
| **Trend/Graph** | Real-time or historical data over time |
| **Group (Faceplate array)** | Side-by-side controller monitoring (e.g., all flow valves) |
| **Topology/Location** | Physical/network layout, fire detection zones |
| **Logic Monitor** | Boolean/function block/ladder logic visualization |
| **Procedural** | Step-by-step sequential operations |
| **Health/Diagnostic** | Network, server, controller status |
| **Alarm List** | Alarm summaries, shelved/suppressed lists |
| **Video** | Live CCTV/process cameras |

## Performance Requirements

- Display call-up: fully populated with live data in 3-5 seconds
- Display refresh: 1-5 seconds (match process dynamics, never sub-second — causes jittery numbers)
- Faceplate refresh: 2-3 seconds
- Write-to-controller acknowledgment: provide immediate visual feedback
- If display load is slow (trends, remote), show graphic first and populate data progressively

## Common Mistakes

1. Using black backgrounds with bright colored elements (causes eye strain, chromatic distortion)
2. Using alarm colors (red, yellow) for non-alarm decoration
3. Creating displays with no clear visual hierarchy — everything looks equally important
4. Over-animating — excessive blinking, flashing, and movement
5. Requiring more than 3 clicks to reach any display
6. Designing for normal operations only — forgetting abnormal/upset scenarios
7. Putting too much information on Level 1 (overview should be scannable in seconds)
8. Using inconsistent color meanings across displays
9. Requiring operators to convert units or perform mental arithmetic
10. Not providing cancel/undo for control actions
